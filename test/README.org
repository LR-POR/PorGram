The testsuite matrix-br-eng.txt is based on the (European) Portuguese
version of the MRS Test Suite:

These Portuguese sentences are translations of the English MRS Test Suite:

Our testsuite targets Brazilian Portuguese. In comparison to the
original European Portuguese MRS Test Suite, we have three types of
situation:

1) The Brazilian Portuguese (BP) translation is the same as the
   European Portuguese (EP):

11 cases

: Choveu.
: It rained.


2) BP has additional translations. In this case, the first translation
   is the EP one:

31

: A janela abriu-se. A janela se abriu. A janela abriu.
: The window opened.

3) EP and BP use different constructions. In this case, the
   translation is prefixed with BR:

351

: BR O cachorro est√° latindo.
: The dog is barking.


It should be noted that our testsuite was designed to test the HPSG
grammar of Portuguese. Therefore, different possible translations were
provided. It can be the case that some of these additional
translations are also licensed in EP. If you have suggestions about
the translations, please contact @leoalenc or open an issue of this
repository, the latter option being preferred.
